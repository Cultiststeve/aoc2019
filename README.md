# Cultiststeve's solutions for Advent of Code 2019

Not optimised or neat / reviewd cocde. Usually just my first draft that produced a solution.

Python 3.8.0, pycharm

# Intcode computer
Spent a little longer making this neat as its used so much.
Includes some pytests, running various day's examples to ensure it produces correct output.
Should also be mostly docstring'd and commented.

## Day 15 solution
*This day was the remote intcode robot searching for an oxygen leak, working out the shortest path then seeing how long it took to refill the entire maze.*

This day made a nice GIF (also pretty useful for debugging).

## Earlier intcode days
Some of these days may be broken in the latest commit, as changes were made to the intcode computer over the first couple weeks, and the early days were not updated.
