# Cultiststeve's solutions for Advent of Code 2019

Not optimised or neat / reviewed code. The code is usually just my first draft that produced a solution and definatly not built with longitivty in mind.

Code developed using  Python 3.8.0 in pycharm.

# Intcode computer
Spent a little longer making this neat as its used so much.
Includes some pytests, running various day's examples to ensure it produces correct output.
Should also be mostly docstring'd and commented.

## Day 15 solution
This day made a nice GIF (also pretty useful for debugging).

## Earlier intcode days
Some of these days may be broken in the latest commit, as changes were made to the intcode computer over the first couple weeks, and the early days were not updated.
